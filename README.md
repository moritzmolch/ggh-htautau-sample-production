# htautau-sample-production

Production of gg &#x2192; H &#x2192; &#x1D70F;&#x1D70F; samples with variable Higgs mass.

The events are generated with `Pythia8` in leading order and interfaced with `FastSIM` for a fast simulation of the CMS detector. The workflow is managed with [law](https://github.com/riga/law).
